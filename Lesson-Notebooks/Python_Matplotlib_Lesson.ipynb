There are many different plotting libraries in Python but by far the most popular is matplotlib and that is what we will be going over. Matplotlib is extremely customizable (to a fault) and with that comes serious plotting power. We will be going over how to use fairly basic plotting features today such as scatter plots, line plots, etc, as well as some beautification/customization capabilities."

This data will almost always take the form of a numpy array but matplotlib can also work with lists, depending on the what you are trying to do.</br></br> Lets try plotting a line. To plot a line in 2d we need to specify the points along the x axis and the corresponding points along the y axis. Recall the equation for a line $ y=mx + b $. Lets generate a numpy array of x-values between 0 and 5, and set a value for m and b to get y-values. Then lets plot them.
